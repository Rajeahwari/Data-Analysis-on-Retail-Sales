# Data-Analysis-on-Retail-Sales

## About the Project

This project was created to practice working with SQL in a real-world context using retail sales data. The idea was to go through all the key steps a data analyst would typically follow — from setting up a database and cleaning the data to running exploratory analysis and answering business questions.

The focus was not just on writing queries, but also on thinking through what kinds of insights a retail business might want from their data.

## Goals

- Set up a structured SQL database for retail sales.
- Clean the dataset by removing incomplete or invalid records.
- Explore the data to get an idea of customer behavior and sales trends.
- Write SQL queries to answer common business-related questions.

## How the Project is Structured

### 1. Setting Up the Database
I started by creating a simple table that included transaction details like the sale date, time, customer info (gender, age), product category, quantity sold, unit price, and total sale value. The goal here was to design a schema that could support both analysis and business reporting.

### 2. Exploring and Cleaning the Data
Before jumping into analysis, I looked at things like:
- How many total records were there?
- Were there any missing values?
- How many unique customers and product categories were present?

After identifying incomplete rows, I cleaned the data to make sure all analysis was based on valid records.

### 3. Analyzing the Data
Once the data was clean, I used SQL queries to explore different aspects of the sales:
- Daily and monthly sales patterns
- Which categories performed best
- Which time of day saw the most orders
- High-value transactions and top customers
- Customer breakdowns by age and gender

## Key Observations

- **Sales Trends**: Some months clearly performed better, possibly due to seasonal demand or promotions.
- **Top Customers**: A small group of customers were responsible for a significant chunk of total sales.
- **Popular Categories**: Products like clothing and beauty stood out in terms of volume and value.
- **Purchase Timing**: Sales were distributed across different shifts — morning, afternoon, and evening — showing varied customer behavior.

## Summary

Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience with writing SQL for data cleaning, exploration, and business analysis. It also helped me understand how data can support decision-making in retail — like identifying peak sales periods or understanding what types of products drive the most revenue.

This was a beginner-friendly project, but it covered all the essentials and helped me build confidence with SQL. I’m planning to expand it later with visual dashboards or maybe even bring in Python for more advanced analysis.
